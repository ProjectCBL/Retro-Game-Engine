# Retro-Game-Engine

## Introduction

This is a basic game engine built on top of the [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com) framework.  The goal of this engine
is to create a simple 2D engine that comes with all the necessary abstraction and functionality needed to immediately
get started in making 2D games in Java.  While LibGDX is an amazing framework for developing games, it can take quite
a while to build the foundation before even taking the first steps.  This engine aims to alleviate that aspect and start
working on your dream game.
